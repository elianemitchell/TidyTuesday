# #TidyTuesday Contributions
My code and visualizations for #TidyTuesday, a weekly social project on Twitter created by the r4ds online learning community. 

After beginning my concerted efforts to learn R in August of 2020 with DataCamp, I decided two months later to try my hand at visualizing data for others to see. Feedback is always welcomed!
