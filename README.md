# #TidyTuesday Contributions
My code and visualizations for #TidyTuesday, a weekly social project on Twitter created by the r4ds online learning community. 

After begininng to concertedly teach myself R in August of 2020, I decided to finally use my Twitter account and try my hand at 
visualizing data for others to see. Feedback is always welcomed. :)
